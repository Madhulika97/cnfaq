3.   What are the transmission modes in physical layer?
Ans. Physical Layer defines the direction of transmission between two devices: Simplex, Half Duplex, Full Duplex.

4.   What are the various networking Topologies?
Ans. Mesh, Star, Ring and Bus
 
5. Bits can be send over guided and unguided media as analog signal by?
   digital modulation
   
6. physical layer provides?
   mechanical specifications of electrical connectors and cables, electrical specification of transmission line signal level, specification for IR over optical fiber

7 .What is the OSI model?
OSI stands for Open Systems Interconnection and
was created by ISO, the International Standards Organization.
The OSI "reference model" divides particular networked processes into seven different layers:
Application (Layer 7) 
Presentation (Layer 6) 
Session (Layer 5) 
Transport (Layer 4) 
Network (Layer 3) 
Data Link (Layer 2)
and Physical (Layer 1)

8.What is the Network Time Protocol

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is a protocol for synchronizing the clocks of computer
systems over packet switched, variable latency data
networks. NTP uses UDP as its transport layer. It is designed particularly to
resist the effects of variable latency.

9.What is virtual network?

An internet architecture in which routers connect multiple physical networks.

10.Is internet a virtual network?
yes An internet is a single virtual network
that interconnects all hosts and through which communication is possible ;its
under lying architecture is both hidden and irrelevant.

11.What are the functions of data link layer in OSI model?

Framing: it divides the stream of bits received from the net
work layer, physical addressing ,flow control ,error control
and access contr

12 .Bits can be send over guided and unguided media as analog signal by which modulation?
  digital modulation

13 .The physical layer translates logical communication requests from the ______ into hardware specific operations. 
   data link layer

14 .A single channel is shared by multiple signals by:    
    multiplexing
    
15. Wireless transmission can be done via:     
   radio waves, microwaves, infrared

16.Why the OSI model was developed?
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) created the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model as a 
framework for defining standards for connecting computers.

17.a physical layer is responsible for:
   line coding,channel coding ,modulation

18.The portion of physical layer that interfaces with the media access control sublayer is called:
   physical signalling sublayer

19.in asynchronous serial communication the physical layer provides:
   start and stop signalling, flow control
