1. What is Computer Network ? 
Computer Network is collection of computers connected together for exchanging information. 

2. Why we need computer network?
Computer network help the user to share the resources and in communication. It useful for file sharing , communication ,
application sharing , lan gaming and many more.

3. What are types of the computer network ? Explain each type.
Ans. Generally, networks are distinguished based on their geographical span. A network
	 can be as small as distance between your mobile phone and its Bluetooth headphone
	 and as large as the internet itself, covering the whole geographical world.
		i.Personal Area Network
			A Personal Area Network (PAN) is smallest network which is very personal to a user.
			This may include Bluetooth enabled devices or infra-red enabled devices. PAN has
			connectivity range up to 10 meters. PAN may include wireless computer keyboard
			and mouse, Bluetooth enabled headphones, wireless printers, and TV remotes.
			For example, Piconet is Bluetooth-enabled Personal Area Network which may contain
			up to 8 devices connected together in a master-slave fashion.
		ii.Local Area Network
			A computer network spanned inside a building and operated under single
			administrative system is generally termed as Local Area Network (LAN). Usually, LAN
			covers an organization offices, schools, colleges or universities. Number of systems
			connected in LAN may vary from as least as two to as much as 16 million.
			LAN provides a useful way of sharing the resources between end users. The resources
			such as printers, file servers, scanners, and internet are easily sharable among
			computers.
			LANs are composed of inexpensive networking and routing equipment. It may
			contains local servers serving file storage and other locally shared applications. It
			mostly operates on private IP addresses and does not involve heavy routing. LAN
			works under its own local domain and controlled centrally.
			LAN uses either Ethernet or Token-ring technology. Ethernet is most widely employed
			LAN technology and uses Star topology, while Token-ring is rarely seen.
			LAN can be wired, wireless, or in both forms at once.
		iii.Metropolitan Area Network
			The Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) generally expands throughout a city such as
			cable TV network. It can be in the form of Ethernet, Token-ring, ATM, or Fiber
			Distributed Data Interface (FDDI).
			Metro Ethernet is a service which is provided by ISPs. This service enables its users
			to expand their Local Area Networks. For example, MAN can help an organization to
			connect all of its offices in a city.
			Backbone of MAN is high-capacity and high-speed fiber optics. MAN works in between
			Local Area Network and Wide Area Network. MAN provides uplink for LANs to WANs
			or internet.
		iv. Wide Area Network
			As the name suggests, the Wide Area Network (WAN) covers a wide area which may
			span across provinces and even a whole country. Generally, telecommunication
			networks are Wide Area Network. These networks provide connectivity to MANs and
			LANs. Since they are equipped with very high speed backbone, WANs use very
			expensive network equipment.
			WAN may use advanced technologies such as Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM),
			Frame Relay, and Synchronous Optical Network (SONET). WAN may be managed by
			multiple administration.
    
4. What are the types of data flows in computer ?
     Simplex :- Communication is unidirectional
     Half Duplex :- Each station can both transmit and receive, but not at the same time
     Full Duplex :- Both stations can transmit and receive simultaneously


5. What are the various network topologies ? 

There are seven basic types of network topologies in the study of network topology:
Point-to-point topology, 
bus (point-to-multipoint) topology, 
ring topology, star topology, 
hybrid topology, 
mesh topology 
and tree topology.


    a)Bus topology consists of one main cable to which all nodes are connected.
    b)Star topology is where all nodes are connected to a central hub using point-to-point connection.
    c)In Ring topology, the computers in the network are connected in a circular fashion, and the data travels in one direction.
    d)Mesh topology is where every node has a direct point-to-point connection to every other node.

5. What are the various network topologies ? Explain them.
Ans. A Network Topology is the arrangement with which computer systems or network
		devices are connected to each other. Topologies may define both physical and logical
		aspect of the network. Both logical and physical topologies could be same or different
		in a same network.
		
		i. Point-to-Point
			Point-to-point networks contains exactly two hosts such as computer, switches,
			routers, or servers connected back to back using a single piece of cable. Often, the
			receiving end of one host is connected to sending end of the other and vice versa.
			If the hosts are connected point-to-point logically, then may have multiple
			intermediate devices. But the end hosts are unaware of underlying network and see
			each other as if they are connected directly.
		ii. Bus Topology
			In case of Bus topology, all devices share single communication line or cable. Bus
			topology may have problem while multiple hosts sending data at the same time.
			Therefore, Bus topology either uses CSMA/CD technology or recognizes one host as
			Bus Master to solve the issue. It is one of the simple forms of networking where a
			failure of a device does not affect the other devices. But failure of the shared
			communication line can make all other devices stop functioning.
			Both ends of the shared channel have line terminator. The data is sent in only one
			direction and as soon as it reaches the extreme end, the terminator removes the data
			from the line.
		iii. Star Topology
			All hosts in Star topology are connected to a central device, known as hub device,
			using a point-to-point connection. That is, there exists a point to point connection
			between hosts and hub. The hub device can be any of the following:
				a. Layer-1 device such as hub or repeater
				b. Layer-2 device such as switch or bridge
				c. Layer-3 device such as router or gateway
			As in Bus topology, hub acts as single point of failure. If hub fails, connectivity of all
			hosts to all other hosts fails. Every communication between hosts takes place through
			only the hub. Star topology is not expensive as to connect one more host, only one
			cable is required and configuration is simple.
		iv. Ring Topology
			In ring topology, each host machine connects to exactly two other machines, creating
			a circular network structure. When one host tries to communicate or send message
			to a host which is not adjacent to it, the data travels through all intermediate hosts.
			To connect one more host in the existing structure, the administrator may need only
			one more extra cable.
			Failure of any host results in failure of the whole ring. Thus, every connection in the
			ring is a point of failure. There are methods which employ one more backup ring.
		v. Mesh Topology
			In this type of topology, a host is connected to one or multiple hosts. This topology
			has hosts in point-to-point connection with every other host or may also have hosts
			which are in point-to-point connection with few hosts only
			Hosts in Mesh topology also work as relay for other hosts which do not have direct
			point-to-point links. Mesh technology comes into two types:
				a. Full Mesh: All hosts have a point-to-point connection to every other host in
				  the network. Thus for every new host n(n-1)/2 connections are required. It
				  provides the most reliable network structure among all network topologies.
				b. Partially Mesh: Not all hosts have point-to-point connection to every other
				  host. Hosts connect to each other in some arbitrarily fashion. This topology
				  exists where we need to provide reliability to some hosts out of all.
		vi. Tree Topology
			Also known as Hierarchical Topology, this is the most common form of network
			topology in use presently. This topology imitates as extended Star topology and
			inherits properties of Bus topology.
			This topology divides the network into multiple levels/layers of network. Mainly in
			LANs, a network is bifurcated into three types of network devices. The lowermost is
			access-layer where computers are attached. The middle layer is known as distribution
			layer, which works as mediator between upper layer and lower layer. The highest
			layer is known as core layer, and is central point of the network, i.e. root of the tree
			from which all nodes fork.
			All neighboring hosts have point-to-point connection between them. Similar to the
			Bus topology, if the root goes down, then the entire network suffers even though it
			is not the single point of failure. Every connection serves as point of failure, failing of
			which divides the network into unreachable segment.
		vii. Daisy Chain
			This topology connects all the hosts in a linear fashion. Similar to Ring topology, all
			hosts are connected to two hosts only, except the end hosts. Means, if the end hosts
			in daisy chain are connected then it represents Ring topology.
			Each link in daisy chain topology represents single point of failure. Every link failure
			splits the network into two segments. Every intermediate host works as relay for its
			immediate hosts.
		viii. Hybrid Topology
			A network structure whose design contains more than one topology is said to be
			hybrid topology. Hybrid topology inherits merits and demerits of all the incorporating
			topologies.
			The above picture represents an arbitrarily hybrid topology. The combining topologies
			may contain attributes of Star, Ring, Bus, and Daisy-chain topologies. Most WANs
			are connected by means of Dual-Ring topology and networks connected to them are
			mostly Star topology networks. Internet is the best example of largest Hybrid
			topology.

7. What is internet ?


    A collection of interconnected networks is internet. Also known as a network of networks.

    The internet is an informal term for the world-wide communication network of computers. It sends information quickly
    between computers around the world. It has millions of smaller domestic, academic, business, and government networks, which 
    together carry many different kinds of information. 
    The World Wide Web is one of its biggest services. It is used by a few billion people all over the world.


8. What is internetwork ?
Ans. Internetwork
		A network of networks is called an internetwork, or simply the internet. It is the
		largest network in existence on this planet. The internet hugely connects all WANs
		and it can have connection to LANs and Home networks. Internet uses TCP/IP
		protocol suite and uses IP as its addressing protocol. Present day, Internet is widely
		implemented using IPv4. Because of shortage of address spaces, it is gradually
		migrating from IPv4 to IPv6.
		Internet enables its users to share and access enormous amount of information
		worldwide. It uses WWW, FTP, email services, audio, and video streaming etc. At
		huge level, internet works on Client-Server model.
		Internet uses very high speed backbone of fiber optics. To inter-connect various
		continents, fibers are laid under sea known to us as submarine communication cable.
		Internet is widely deployed on World Wide Web services using HTML linked pages
		and is accessible by client software known as Web Browsers. When a user requests
		a page using some web browser located on some Web Server anywhere in the world,
		the Web Server responds with the proper HTML page. The communication delay is
		very low.
		Internet is serving many proposes and is involved in many aspects of life. Some of
		them are:
		a. Web sites
		b. E-mail
		c. Instant Messaging
		d. Blogging
		e. Social Media
		f. Marketing
		g. Networking
		h. Resource Sharing
		i. Audio and Video Streaming

12. What is a node?
Ans.    A node refers to a point or joint where a connection takes place. 
        It can be computer or device that is part of a network. 
        Two or more nodes are needed in order to form a network connection.
        
13.  What are routers?
Ans.    Routers can connect two or more network segments. These are intelligent network devices that store information 
        in its routing table such as paths, hops and bottlenecks. 
        With this info, they are able to determine the best path for data transfer. Routers operate at the OSI Network Layer.
        
14. Name the types of reference models.
    a)OSI Reference model (Open Systems interconnection).
    b)TCP/IP Reference model.
    
15. What are protocols?
    Protocol is a standard used to define a method of exchanging data over a computer network.
    For example : TCP, IP, UDP, POP, SMTP, HTTP, and FTP 



16. Function of OSI Model?

    Layer 7: The application layer. This is the layer at which communication partners are identified (Is there someone 
        to talk to?), network capacity is assessed (Will the network let me talk to them right now?), and that creates a 
        thing to send or opens the thing received.  (This layer is not the application itself, it is the set of services 
        an application should be able to make use of directly, although some applications may perform application layer 
        functions.)
    
    Layer 6: The presentation layer. This layer is usually part of an operating system (OS) and converts incoming and 
        outgoing data from one presentation format to another (for example, from clear text to encrypted text at one 
        end and back to clear text at the other).

    Layer 5: The session layer. This layer sets up, coordinates and terminates conversations. Services include 
        authentication and reconnection after an interruption. On the Internet, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and 
        User Datagram Protocol (UDP) provide these services for most applications.

    Layer 4: The transport layer. This layer manages packetization of data, then the delivery of the packets, including 
        checking for errors in the data once it arrives. On the Internet, TCP and UDP provide these services for most 
        applications as well.

    Layer 3: The network layer. This layer handles the addressing and routing of the data (sending it in the right direction 
        to the right destination on outgoing transmissions and receiving incoming transmissions at the packet level). IP is the 
        network layer for the Internet.

    Layer 2: The data-link layer. This layer sets up links across the physical network, putting packets into network frames. 
        This layer has two sub-layers, the Logical Link Control Layer and the Media Access Control Layer. Ethernet is the main 
        data link layer in use.

    Layer 1: The physical layer. This layer conveys the bit stream through the network at the electrical, optical or 
        radio level. It provides the hardware means of sending and receiving data on a carrier networ

21. Mention Classification of Computer Networks.
Ans.	Computer networks are classified based on various factors. They include:
			i.Geographical span
			ii.Inter-connectivity
			iii.Administration
			iv.Architecture

22. What is Geographical Span in Computer Networks?
Ans.	Geographically a network can be seen in one of the following categories:
			i. It may be spanned across your table, among Bluetooth enabled devices,ranging not more than few meters.
			ii. It may be spanned across a whole building, including intermediate devices to connect all floors.
			iii. It may be spanned across a whole city.
			iv. It may be spanned across multiple cities or provinces.
			v. It may be one network covering whole world.

23. What is Inter-Connectivity in Computer Networks?
Ans. Components of a network can be connected to each other differently in some fashion.
	 By connectedness we mean either logically, physically, or both ways.
		i. Every single device can be connected to every other device on network, making the network mesh.
		ii. All devices can be connected to a single medium but geographically disconnected, created bus-like structure.
		iii. Each device is connected to its left and right peers only, creating linear structure.
		iv. All devices connected together with a single device, creating star-like structure.
		v. All devices connected arbitrarily using all previous ways to connect each other, resulting in a hybrid structure.

24. What is Administration in Computer Networks?
Ans. From an administrator’s point of view, a network can be private network which belongs a single autonomous system and 
		cannot be accessed outside its physical or logical domain. A network can be public, which is accessed by all.

25. What is Network Architecture in Computer Networks?
Ans. Computer networks can be discriminated into various types such as Client-Server,peer-to-peer or hybrid, depending upon its architecture.
		i. There can be one or more systems acting as Server. Other being Client, requests the Server to serve requests. 
		Server takes and processes request on behalf of Clients.
		ii. Two systems can be connected Point-to-Point, or in back-to-back fashion. They both reside at the same level and called peers.
		iii. There can be hybrid network which involves network architecture of both the above types.
		
26. What is Network Applications in Computer Networks?
Ans. Computer systems and peripherals are connected to form a network. They provide numerous advantages:
		i. Resource sharing such as printers and storage devices
		ii. Exchange of information by means of e-Mails and FTP
		iii. Information sharing by using Web or Internet
		iv. Interaction with other users using dynamic web pages
		v. IP phones
		vi. Video conferences
		vii. Parallel computing
		viii. Instant messaging

27. What is Ethernet?
Ans. Ethernet
		Ethernet is a widely deployed LAN technology. This technology was invented by Bob
		Metcalfe and D.R. Boggs in the year 1970. It was standardized in IEEE 802.3 in 1980.
		Ethernet shares media. Network which uses shared media has high probability of
		data collision. Ethernet uses Carrier Sense Multi Access/Collision Detection
		(CSMA/CD) technology to detect collisions. On the occurrence of collision in Ethernet,
		all its hosts roll back, wait for some random amount of time, and then re-transmit
		the data.
		Ethernet connector is network interface card equipped with 48-bits MAC address. This
		helps other Ethernet devices to identify and communicate with remote devices in
		Ethernet.
		Traditional Ethernet uses 10BASE-T specifications. The number 10 depicts 10MBPS
		speed, BASE stands for baseband, and T stands for Thick Ethernet. 10BASE-T
		Ethernet provides transmission speed up to 10MBPS and uses coaxial cable or Cat-5
		twisted pair cable with RJ-5 connector. Ethernet follows Star topology with segment
		length up to 100 meters. All devices are connected to a hub/switch in a star fashion.

28. What is meant by RIP?

->RIP short for Routing Information Protocol is used by routers to send data from one network to another.
  It efficiently manages routing data by broadcasting its routing table to all other routers within the network.

29. What does 10Base-T mean?

->The 10 refers to the data transfer rate, in this case is 10Mbps. The word Base refers to base band, as oppose to broad band. T means twisted pair, which is the cable used for that network.


30. What are MAC addresses?

MAC, or Media Access Control, uniquely identifies a device on the network. It is also known as physical address or Ethernet address. 
A MAC address is made up of 6-byte parts.
